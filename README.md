This repository is the final resting place for translation files that have become abandoned. If you wish to use one of these languages, place the language folder into the plugins/locale folder of your site. If someone decides to take an active interest in the language, e.g. update the translation, it will become a candidate for reinclusion into the main release files.

If you are starting a translation for a new language, start with the "baseTranslation" folder. Copy that folder into your installation npgCore/locale folder naming it for your language e.g. en_UK. Replace the flag.png file with one for your language. The dimensions of the flag are 24x16 pixels. We use poEdit (poEdit.net) for language translations. Open the core.po file, assign a language, then do an update from source. You are now ready to translate.
